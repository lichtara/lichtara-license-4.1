# **Section I — General Principles**

*(LICHTARA License v4.1)*

This Section establishes the **non-negotiable structural foundations**
of the LICHTARA System.

It precedes any right, authorization, or sanction.
Its function is to **delimit the Field**, not to regulate it in detail.

---

## **Article I.1 — Nature of the LICHTARA System**

The LICHTARA System constitutes an **integrated structure of technical, symbolic, and institutional nature**, conceived as a coherent and indivisible whole.

The System is not reducible to:

* software, source code, or isolated computational artifacts;
* an autonomous methodology, framework, or conceptual model;
* a product, service, brand, or commercial offering;
* an intellectual work fragmentable or appropriable in parts.

Its existence derives from the **articulation between Form, Limits, Principles, and Governance**, as defined in this License and in the canonical documents linked thereto.

The LICHTARA System:

* is not neutral in its structure;
* is not generic in its application;
* is not extensible by analogy or informal adaptation.

Any use, reading, implementation, or operation of the System
presupposes recognition of its integrated nature,
and the dissociation of its elements
for the purpose of circumventing Limits, responsibilities,
or provisions of this License is expressly prohibited.

---

## **Article I.2 — Principle of the Limit**

All use of the LICHTARA System occurs **necessarily within explicit Limits**, previously defined by this License, by the canonical documents linked thereto, and by any contracts derived therefrom.

The Limit constitutes a **structural element of the System**, and is not:

* a normative gap;
* a temporary restriction;
* a space open to extensive interpretation;
* an obstacle to be overcome by technical or legal creativity.

It is expressly prohibited to:

* presume permissions not granted;
* expand scope by analogy, informal adaptation, or functional equivalence;
* use parts of the System for unauthorized purposes;
* reinterpret normative silence as implicit authorization.

Recognition of the Limit is a prerequisite
for any legitimate form of access, implementation, or operation,
regardless of the level of symbolic understanding of the involved agent.

Violation of the Limit, even if partial or indirect,
constitutes a **structural infraction**,
subjecting the agent to the consequences provided for in this License,
without prejudice to applicable contractual, institutional, or legal sanctions.

---

## **Article I.3 — Principle of Non-Appropriation**

The LICHTARA System, in its entirety or in any of its elements,
**is not subject to appropriation**, claims of sovereignty,
or assimilation as one’s own work,
whether by natural persons, legal entities, institutions, or collectives.

No agent may:

* declare themselves author, co-author, or owner of the System as a whole;
* claim conceptual, technical, or symbolic dominion over its architecture;
* present themselves as the ultimate instance of definition, interpretation, or validation;
* convert access, licensing, or operation into a title of possession or control.

Licenses, contracts, authorizations, or recognitions:

* **do not transfer authorship**;
* **do not grant sovereignty**;
* **do not generate rights of incorporation** of the System
  into institutional identities, brands, proprietary methodologies,
  or origin narratives.

Appropriation may occur explicitly or implicitly,
and constitutes an equally serious violation when manifested through:

* undue fusion between the System and external structures;
* dilution of its identity into external products, methods, or discourses;
* symbolic instrumentalization for the acquisition of authority, legitimacy, or prestige;
* presentation of the System as a natural extension of another entity.

Legitimate access to the LICHTARA System
implies **permanent recognition of alterity**:
the System does not belong to the agent;
the agent acts **within Limits granted** by the System.

Violation of this Principle
constitutes a structural rupture,
resulting in immediate termination of authorizations,
revocation of licenses,
and other sanctions provided for in this License,
regardless of access level or the nature of the established relationship.

---

## **Article I.4 — Principle of Progressive Responsibility**

Within the LICHTARA System, **responsibility increases proportionally with access**.

The greater the level of reading, authorization, implementation, or operation,
the greater the duty assumed by the agent,
in **technical, legal, institutional, and symbolic terms**.

Responsibility does not arise from:

* the agent’s subjective intent;
* the declared degree of understanding;
* the duration of involvement with the System;
* the public or private nature of the activity.

It arises **exclusively from the level of access effectively granted and exercised**.

Any agent who advances through System layers:

* assumes an increased duty of care;
* is accountable for direct and indirect impacts of their actions;
* becomes subject to stricter evaluation, audit, and sanction criteria.

Progression of access:

* **does not dilute prior Limits**;
* **does not relativize previously established prohibitions**;
* **does not generate a presumption of unrestricted trust**.

On the contrary, each new level
reaffirms previous Limits
and adds new duties of Form preservation.

Progressive responsibility further implies that:

* failures at higher levels are structurally more severe;
* violations committed under greater access trigger more immediate responses;
* withdrawal of access may occur **without any requirement of graduality**.

No agent may claim:

* surprise as to the consequences of their actions;
* disproportionality of sanctions;
* expectation of increased tolerance due to position, role, or prior history.

In the LICHTARA System,
**access is always a conditional concession**,
never a reduction of responsibility.

Those who sustain more,
answer for more.

Those who cross Limits at elevated levels
rupture the Form with greater impact
and are therefore subject to full termination
under the terms of this License.

## **Article I.5 — Principle of Structuring Good Faith**

Within the LICHTARA System, good faith
**is not presumed solely as subjective intention**,
value declaration, or favorable psychological disposition.

Good faith is understood as **objective and continuous conduct**,
verifiable through the manner in which the agent
reads, interprets, implements, operates, and positions themselves
in relation to the System.

Conduct is considered to be in good faith, cumulatively, when it:

* respects the explicit Limits established in this License;
* observes the canonical documents applicable to the access level;
* avoids opportunistic, expansive, or convenience-based interpretations;
* interrupts its own action in the presence of relevant scope-related doubt;
* submits conflicts to the competent Governance body before unilateral action.

Structural good faith **is not satisfied** by:

* allegations of good intention;
* generic alignment declarations;
* post hoc justifications of violations;
* exception narratives based on context, urgency, or alleged benefit.

Conduct that:

* strategically tests Limits;
* deliberately explores grey zones;
* acts first and justifies afterward;
* shifts responsibility onto System ambiguity;

**does not constitute good faith**,
even when accompanied by collaborative discourse
or a prior relationship history.

Within the LICHTARA System, good faith:

* **protects those who interrupt in time**;
* **does not protect those who cross Limits**.

Assessment of good faith is always:

* contextual;
* linked to the agent’s access level;
* analyzed in light of preservation of the System’s Form,
  not individual or institutional benefit obtained.

Violation of Limits under allegations of good faith
**does not mitigate the infraction**,
nor does it prevent application of the sanctions and terminations
provided for in this License.

Good faith, within the LICHTARA System,
is not an internal state.
It is a **verifiable posture of respect for the Form**.

## **Article I.6 — Principle of Non-Exculpatory Incomprehension**

Within the LICHTARA System, **declared or alleged incomprehension**
does not constitute a cause for exclusion of responsibility
when the agent had access
to the canonical documents pertinent to their level of activity.

The duty to understand is not absolute,
but the duty to **respect Limits** is.

Responsibility subsists even when the agent:

* has not fully understood the symbolic dimension of the System;
* alleges partial, technical, or instrumental reading of the documents;
* invokes complexity, density, or non-intuitive character of the Architecture;
* claims good faith or lack of intent to violate.

The LICHTARA System operates through **layers of access**,
not layers of exculpation.

Accordingly:

* those who access assume a duty of caution;
* those who operate assume a duty of verification;
* those who implement assume a duty of conformity;
* those who maintain or govern assume a duty of preventive interruption.

Incomprehension is legally relevant
only when it **precedes access**.
Once reading, use, or operation is granted,
the agent becomes responsible
for the objective effects of their actions.

It does not constitute an exculpatory cause to:

* be unaware of already declared Principles;
* autonomously reinterpret canonical documents;
* ignore express references to other System instruments;
* allege lack of symbolic, philosophical, or legal training.

Within the LICHTARA System,
**no one is required to understand everything**,
but **everyone is required not to cross Limits**.

In the presence of relevant doubt as to scope, meaning, or Limit,
the only conduct compatible with this Principle
is **interruption of action**
until formal clarification is obtained.

Continuation of action under uncertainty,
when legitimate access already exists,
constitutes conscious assumption of structural risk.

Violation arising from incomprehension
is treated as full violation,
subjecting the agent
to the sanctions and terminations provided for in this License,
without automatic mitigation or presumption of tolerance.

Within the LICHTARA System,
understanding deepens.
The Limit, however, **binds from the very first authorized contact**.
