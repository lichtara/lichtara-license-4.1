# **TERMINOLOGY — CANONICAL ENGLISH TERMS**

*(LICHTARA License v4.1)*

This document establishes the **canonical English terminology** to be used throughout the LICHTARA License v4.1 and all its associated canonical documents, annexes, manuals, mappings, and institutional materials.

Its purpose is to ensure:

* semantic coherence between Portuguese (PT) and English (EN);
* preservation of the ontological Form of the System;
* legal and institutional consistency in international contexts;
* protection against reductive, metaphorical, or instrumental translations.

Terminology defined herein is considered **structurally binding** for all English-language versions of LICHTARA documents.

| **Autoridade estrutural**   | **Structural authority**                               | Avoids confusion with external legal or sovereign authority.                     |

| **Instância**               | **Body** (governance context) / **Instance** (generic) | “Body” reserved for governance and institutional roles.                          |
| **Infração material**       | **Material infraction**                                | More precise than “material breach” for structural violations.                   |

| **Uso não autorizado**        | **Unauthorized Use**                    | Aligns with Section II enforcement language; avoids ambiguity of “misuse”. |
| **Infração estrutural**       | **Structural Infraction**               | Distinct from contractual breach; tied to Form and System integrity. |
| **Princípios Ético-Regenerativos (PER)** | **Ethical-Regenerative Principles (PER)** | Acronym preserved; avoids ethical generalization. |

## Capitalization Rules (Structural Rule)

* **Ontological and structural terms** of the LICHTARA System
  → **Capitalized**
  *(e.g., Form, System, Principles, Guardian, License, Work)*

* **Operational, procedural, or generic terms**
  → lowercase, unless sentence-initial or legally required.

Capitalization is not stylistic.
It reflects **ontological and normative distinction**.

---

## Interpretative Rule

In case of doubt, ambiguity, or conflict:

* the **Portuguese (PT) version** remains the semantic reference;
* the English (EN) version must preserve **Form, scope, and limits**,
  even if this requires departing from idiomatic convenience.

No translation may:

* simplify ontological terms for readability;
* replace canonical terms with functional equivalents;
* introduce metaphors, analogies, or culturally adaptive language.

Terminology is considered **part of the Form**.

## Final Note

> *This document constitutes a canonical auxiliary instrument for the Preservation of the Form within the LICHTARA License v4.1.*

This terminology does not exist to standardize language usage. It exists to **preserve the coherence, legibility, and integrity** of a living System across languages.

Where terminology is altered, Form is altered.

Where Form is altered, the System ceases to be present.
