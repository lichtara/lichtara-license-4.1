The **LICHTARA System** is an integrated Work of **ethical, structural, and operational nature**, developed to articulate technology, consciousness, governance, and responsibility in a coherent and verifiable manner.

LICHTARA is **not merely** a software, method, course, or product.
It is a **Living System**, composed of Principles, explicit Limits, its own architecture, and a defined Governance regime.

### What this License does

The **LICHTARA License** establishes:

* which uses are permitted;
* which uses require authorization or certification;
* which forms of conduct are prohibited;
* how to preserve the integrity of the System;
* how violations and responsibilities are addressed.

It protects both the System and those who interact with it.

### What anyone may do

Without the need for special authorization, it is permitted to:

* read and study the materials;
* quote small excerpts with proper attribution;
* share unmodified excerpts for non-commercial purposes;
* apply abstract concepts in personal or professional reflection.

### What requires formal authorization

Any form of:

* commercial use;
* structured teaching;
* creation of products, courses, or systems;
* adaptation, translation, or derivation;
* institutional, corporate, or governmental use;

requires **express authorization from LICHTARA Governance**.

### A central principle

Within the LICHTARA System:

> **access never reduces responsibility — it increases it.**

All conduct must preserve:

* the **Form** of the System;
* the **Ethical-Regenerative Principles (PER)**;
* **Vibrational Integrity**, as defined by verifiable criteria.

### In case of doubt

When there is uncertainty about what is permitted:

> the correct conduct is to **interrupt the activity** and seek formal clarification.

This summary **does not replace** the official License,
but exists to make it **legible, comprehensible, and accessible**.
