# LICHTARA License v4.1 — Official Deposit

## Overview

This repository contains the official publication of **LICHTARA License v4.1**, a foundational legal and structural instrument governing access, use, implementation, and derivation of the **LICHTARA System**.

The LICHTARA System is not a conventional software product, methodology, or intellectual work. It constitutes a **living, governed system of structure, coherence, and responsibility**, whose integrity depends on preservation of its Form.

This deposit is intended to provide an **authoritative, citable, and stable reference** for the LICHTARA License v4.1 within an international research and archival context.
